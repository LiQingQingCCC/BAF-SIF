BAF-SIF: Bidirectional Attention-based Sparse Image Fusion

Overview
This repository contains the core implementation of a novel fusion framework specifically designed for sparse medical images, particularly those generated through preprocessing pipelines (e.g., CTA-derived diffusion and vascular images). The method employs a Bidirectional Attention Fusion Module (BAFM)​ with joint loss optimization​ to achieve high-quality fusion results.
✨ Key Features
Bidirectional Attention Fusion Module (BAFM): Enables deep, interactive feature learning between sparse image modalities
Joint Loss Optimization: Combines reconstruction and classification losses for enhanced fusion quality
Sparse-Image Specific: Designed specifically for preprocessing-generated sparse images
Interactive 3D Visualization: Includes a visualization pipeline for clinical interpretation
